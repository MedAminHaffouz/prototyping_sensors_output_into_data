# Prototype : getting data from sensor into database to perform analysis on it later
**NB :** It is still a prototype and still needs more work
This github will host the idea of turning the data inputted by sensors into usable data 
## Phase 1 :
* The arduino takes the input of the potentiometer and the DHT11 (humidity and temperature sensor) into the Serial to be captured by python scripts into an sqlite db then saved into a csv file to be used in a simple data analysis in a jupyter notebook
This practise aims at embracing the principles of getting the sensors input into usable data

*This project will witness more improvement per time*
